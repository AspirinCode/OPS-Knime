OPS-Knime
=========

Project for integration of OPS and the Knime workflow engine (http://www.knime.org/)

The committed code shows an example Knime plug-in that retrieves data based on the Enzyme Classification API using the Linked Data API.

Installation
------------
* Copy the jar file in plugins to the "dropins" folder of your KNIME installation

TODO

* Better error handling
* Configuration options should present only available choices
* Configuration options should give range restrictions for the activity value
